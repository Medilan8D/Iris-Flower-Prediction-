# Iris-Flower-Prediction-
The Iris flower classification problem is a popular dataset in machine learning, often used for beginners to understand classification techniques. 
The dataset was introduced by British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 and consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.
Features (Attributes): Four features are recorded for each flower sample:
Sepal length (in cm)
Sepal width (in cm)
Petal length (in cm)
Petal width (in cm)
Target Variable: Each flower is labeled as belonging to one of the three species:
Iris setosa
Iris versicolor
Iris virginica
The objective is to classify new samples into one of the three species based on the four features provided.
